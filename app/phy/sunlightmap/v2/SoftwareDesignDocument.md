## 1. Introduction

The Day-and-Night Map Software is a project aimed at providing users with a visual representation of global day and night regions on a static map. This design document outlines the architectural decisions, user interface design, and technical implementation details for the software.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The software will be built as a cross-platform mobile application using a combination of frontend technologies. The frontend will communicate with backend APIs for location data and daylight information.

### Frontend Technologies

- todo

### Backend Services

- External APIs for reverse geocoding and daylight data.
- Custom APIs for user data management, location storage, and notifications (future iteration).

## 3. User Interface Design

The user interface will maintain a minimalistic design to keep the focus on the primary functionality of displaying day and night regions.

### Main Screen

- The map will be the central element, displaying the world map with dynamic day and night regions.
- Location pins will be represented by small colored dots on the map.
- A floating action button will provide access to the location entry form.

### Location Entry Form

- Users will access the form by clicking the floating action button.
- The form will include text input fields for location name and an auto-suggest field for location selection.
- After selecting a location, users can save it to their list of locations.

### Settings Page

- Users will access the settings page through the app's navigation.
- Preset options for map centering, update frequency, and location service will be provided.
- Audible alerts toggle will be available for each location.

### About Page

- The about page will display the story behind the software, its purpose, and a feedback invitation.

## 4. Technical Implementation

### Map Rendering

- xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The Mapbox library will be used to render the static map with Mercator projection.
- Day and night regions will be updated based on real-time data from external APIs.

### Location Storage

- User-added locations will be stored locally using Redux for state management.
- In future iterations, backend APIs will be integrated for data synchronization.

### Audible Alerts

- Toggleable audible alerts will be implemented using platform-specific audio APIs.
- Users can choose to enable or disable audible alerts for each location.

## 5. Future Enhancements

The software's roadmap includes the following features for future iterations:

- **Push Notifications:** Implement push notifications to alert users about significant day-night transitions.
- **Time Zone Customization:** Allow users to set custom time zones for specific locations.
- **Weather Integration:** Integrate weather data for location-specific weather conditions.
- **Interactive Dot Tap:** Enable interaction with location pins to provide additional information.
- **Advanced Theme Customization:** Provide more customization options for map themes beyond day and night.

## 6. Conclusion

The Day-and-Night Map Software's design encompasses a cross-platform mobile application built on the xxxxxxxxxx framework. It focuses on a user-friendly interface that allows users to visualize day and night regions across the globe. Future enhancements will further enrich the software's capabilities and user experience.
