### **Project Brief: Git Branching and CI/CD Strategy for UiPath RPA Projects**

---

**Objective**:  
To design and implement a cohesive Git branching scheme integrated with a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for the deployment of UiPath RPA projects.

**Scope**:  
The strategy should cater to potentially hundreds of individual UiPath RPA projects, each residing in its own repository, while ensuring standardized practices across the board.

---

**Branching Scheme**:

1. **Development and Feature Branches**:

   - `feature/<feature_name>`: Dedicated for new features.
   - `bugfix/<issue_number>`: Used for specific bug fixes.
   - `dev/<developer_name_or_id>/<short_description>`: Optional branches for specific developers or teams.

2. **Integration and Release Branches**:
   - `test-orchestrator`: Represents the testing environment.
   - `prod-orchestrator`: Represents the production environment.

**Workflow**:

- Developers will work on feature, bugfix, or their personal branches.
- Upon completion, developers will raise Pull Requests (PRs) to the `test-orchestrator` branch.
- Post testing, PRs from `test-orchestrator` to `prod-orchestrator` will be made, ensuring only tested code reaches the production environment.

---

**CI/CD Integration with Jenkins**:

1. **Triggers**:

   - Jenkins will be configured to trigger builds on PR events.
   - PRs from feature, bugfix, or developer branches to `test-orchestrator` will initiate a build targeting the UiPath Test Orchestrator.
   - PRs from `test-orchestrator` to `prod-orchestrator` will initiate a build targeting the UiPath Prod Orchestrator.

2. **Deployment**:

   - Jenkins will deploy the RPA projects to the respective UiPath Orchestrators post successful build.

3. **Access Controls**:
   - Branch protection will be enforced, especially for `prod-orchestrator`.
   - PRs will require at least one reviewer's approval to ensure code quality.

---

**Considerations**:

1. **Shared Components**: The strategy should ensure versioning compatibility across shared components.

2. **Documentation**: Documentation will be paramount to ensure standardized practices. All processes, from branching to deployment, will be thoroughly documented.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Proper tools will be set in place for monitoring the deployed RPA projects. Any anomalies should be flagged for immediate attention.

---

**Timeline**:  
To be defined based on team size, current state of projects, and any existing integrations.

**Resources**:

- Git repositories for RPA projects.
- Jenkins setup with appropriate plugins.
- UiPath Test and Production Orchestrators.

**Key Stakeholders**:

- RPA Developers
- DevOps Engineers
- Code Reviewers
- Project Management Team

---

**Next Steps**:

1. Conduct a workshop to communicate the branching strategy to all stakeholders.
2. Set up Jenkins jobs as per the defined strategy.
3. Implement branch protection rules on Git repositories.
4. Begin a phased rollout, starting with pilot RPA projects to ensure smooth transition.
