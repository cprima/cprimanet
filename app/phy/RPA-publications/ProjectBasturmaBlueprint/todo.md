- **Step 2:** Specify the number of required approving reviews (set to at least 1).
- **Step 3:** Save changes.

#### 5. Prevent direct pushes to the `prod-orchestrator` branch.

- **Step 1:** Under the branch protection rules for `prod-orchestrator`, ensure "Restrict who can push to matching branches" is checked.
- **Step 2:** Optionally, you can specify a group of users or teams who can push, but it's recommended to leave it restricted.

#### 6. Ensure appropriate access levels for developers, reviewers, and administrators.

- **Step 1:** Go to the repository and navigate to Settings > Manage Access.
- **Step 2:** Click on "Invite teams or people".

- **Step 2:** Click "Add webhook".
- **Step 3:** Provide the Payload URL (usually your Jenkins URL followed by `/github-webhook/`).
- **Step 4:** Set the content type to `application/json`.
- **Step 5:** Under "Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?", select "Pull requests".
- **Step 6:** Click "Add webhook".

These steps should set up the necessary GitHub configurations as per the tasks. Ensure you test the setups, especially the integrations with Jenkins, to confirm they work as expected.

### **Jenkins Tasks**:

#### 1. Ensure Jenkins has the required plugins, especially the GitHub and UiPath integrations.

- **Step 1:** Login to your Jenkins server.
- **Step 2:** Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins".
- **Step 3:** Go to the "Available" tab and search for "GitHub" and "UiPath" plugins.
- **Step 4:** Select the plugins and click on "Install without restart" (or choose to restart if needed).

#### 2. Set up build nodes if parallel processing or specific environment requirements are there.

- **Step 1:** Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Nodes and Clouds".
- **Step 2:** Click "New Node", provide a name and select "Permanent Agent".
- **Step 3:** Configure node details like remote root directory, labels, and launch method (e.g., Launch agents via SSH).
- **Step 4:** Save and ensure the node is online and connected.

#### 3. Create a parameterized Jenkins job to handle builds for both `test-orchestrator` and `prod-orchestrator`.

- **Step 1:** Click on "New Item" from the Jenkins dashboard.
- **Step 2:** Provide a name, select "Freestyle project", and click "OK".
- **Step 3:** Under "General", check "This project is parameterized" and add a String Parameter named "TARGET_ENVIRONMENT" with choices `test-orchestrator` and `prod-orchestrator`.
- **Step 4:** Configure the Source Code Management, Build, and Post-build Actions based on the value of "TARGET_ENVIRONMENT".

#### 4. Configure the job to be triggered by PR events from GitHub.

- **Step 1:** In the job configuration, navigate to the "Build Triggers" section.
- **Step 2:** Check "GitHub Pull Request Builder".
- **Step 3:** Define the filter criteria for the PRs, e.g., source branch, target branch.
- **Step 4:** Save the configuration.

#### 5. Set up post-build actions for deployments to the respective UiPath Orchestrators.

- **Step 1:** In the job configuration, navigate to the "Post-build Actions" section.
- **Step 2:** Add an action (using the UiPath plugin or scripts) to deploy to the UiPath Orchestrator.
- **Step 3:** Use the "TARGET_ENVIRONMENT" parameter to conditionally determine the destination orchestrator.

#### 6. Configure notification mechanisms for build successes, failures, and deployments.

- **Step 1:** In the job configuration, go to "Post-build Actions".
- **Step 2:** Click "Add post-build action" and select a notification method like "E-mail Notification" or "Slack Notification".
- **Step 3:** Configure the necessary details like recipients, channels, and conditions for sending notifications.
- **Step 4:** Save the configuration.

#### 7. Ensure regular backups of Jenkins configurations, jobs, and build artifacts.

- **Step 1:** Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins".
- **Step 2:** Search for and install the "ThinBackup" plugin or a similar backup solution.
- **Step 3:** Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "ThinBackup" and configure backup settings such as location, frequency, and what to include/exclude.
- **Step 4:** Save the settings and, if desired, initiate a manual backup to test the setup.

#### 8. Document and test a recovery plan in case of failures or data loss.

- **Step 1:** Create a detailed recovery procedure document, outlining steps to restore Jenkins from backups.
- **Step 2:** Store this document in a secure and accessible location.
- **Step 3:** Periodically test the recovery procedure in a staging environment to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

These steps should help in setting up the Jenkins tasks as per the requirements. Ensure that after setting up, you thoroughly test each configuration to ensure that it behaves as expected, especially in terms of integrations between Jenkins, GitHub, and UiPath Orchestrator.

### **UiPath Orchestrator Tasks**:

#### 1. Ensure the UiPath Orchestrators (both Test and Prod) are accessible from the Jenkins environment.

- **Step 1:** Log in to the UiPath Orchestrator web interface.
- **Step 2:** Check the connection and accessibility by pinging the Orchestrator's URL from the Jenkins server or using a browser from the Jenkins host.
- **Step 3:** If there are issues, consult with your network team to ensure proper firewall and routing configurations.

#### 2. Set up or verify deployment targets and permissions.

- **Step 1:** In UiPath Orchestrator, navigate to the "Robots" section.
- **Step 2:** Ensure that you have robots set up for the environments (`test-orchestrator` and `prod-orchestrator`).
- **Step 3:** Assign the robots to the respective environments.

#### 3. Establish a versioning scheme for deployed RPA processes.

- **Step 1:** Decide on a versioning pattern, e.g., Semantic Versioning (`major.minor.patch`).
- **Step 2:** Document this pattern and share it with the development team.
- **Step 3:** Ensure that each deployment to the Orchestrator has the version clearly labeled.

#### 4. Ensure a mechanism to roll back deployments in case of issues.

- **Step 1:** When publishing a new package/version in Orchestrator, ensure the older versions are retained.
- **Step 2:** In case of issues with the latest deployed version, revert to the previous stable version using the Orchestrator's web interface.

### **Other Tasks**:

#### 1. Document the entire CI/CD process.

- **Step 1:** Start with a high-level overview of the process flow.
- **Step 2:** Break down each stage, explaining its purpose, tools involved, and the operations performed.
- **Step 3:** Include screenshots, code snippets, and configuration details where applicable.
- **Step 4:** Regularly update the documentation as the process evolves.

#### 2. Keep a version-controlled documentation repository or a dedicated documentation platform.

- **Step 1:** Create a new repository in GitHub specifically for documentation.
- **Step 2:** Use a documentation tool or platform, e.g., MkDocs or Docusaurus, to structure your documentation.
- **Step 3:** Commit and push changes to the repository regularly to maintain version history.

#### 3. Integrate monitoring tools for the deployed RPA projects in UiPath Orchestrator.

- **Step 1:** Identify a monitoring solution compatible with UiPath Orchestrator, e.g., Elastic Stack (ELK).
- **Step 2:** Set up the monitoring solution and integrate it with the Orchestrator.
- **Step 3:** Configure dashboards or views to track key performance and operational metrics of the RPA processes.

#### 4. Set up alerts for any anomalies or operational issues.

- **Step 1:** In your monitoring tool, define thresholds or criteria for potential issues.
- **Step 2:** Configure alerts to notify the relevant teams or individuals when these thresholds are breached.
- **Step 3:** Test the alerting mechanism to ensure timely and accurate notifications.

#### 5. Establish a feedback mechanism for developers and stakeholders.

- **Step 1:** Set up a feedback collection platform, e.g., a shared mailbox, a form, or a ticketing system.
- **Step 2:** Share the platform details with all involved parties.
- **Step 3:** Regularly review the feedback and incorporate relevant suggestions into the CI/CD process.

#### 6. Organize training sessions or workshops for developers and stakeholders.

- **Step 1:** Identify the training needs of the teams involved.
- **Step 2:** Arrange for trainers or experts in the relevant domains.
- **Step 3:** Schedule training sessions, ensuring they're recorded for future references.
- **Step 4:** Take feedback post-training to continually improve the sessions.

Make sure that for each of these tasks, especially the ones that involve system changes or configurations, you take backups and ensure rollback strategies in case of any issues.
