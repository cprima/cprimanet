- wrote content plan

### 2023-10-19

- used ChatGPT to brainstorm a mission statement, beginning with names for Armenian dishes, and merging into the context of CI/CD, DevOps and software quality lingo

  > In the continuous cycle of DevOps, where every iteration matters, `<Project[Basturma] version="Blueprint-0.9" />` serves as a template for excellence, ensuring every UiPath RPA project meets the gold standard in code quality.

- used ChatGPT to implement minimal integration examples

  1. CI/CD Triggering: Inquired about triggering CI/CD pipelines from GitHub, specifically with a Jenkins setup in a local network.

  1. Network Setup: A network diagram was presented to visualize the communication between GitHub.com, a modem/router, and a local server with Jenkins.

  1. GitHub Webhooks: Discussed how webhooks can be set up to trigger Jenkins builds when certain events (like a push or pull request) occur on a GitHub repository.

  1. GitHub Template Repositories: We covered that while webhooks themselves can't be directly templated in a GitHub repository template, other mechanisms (like pull request templates) could potentially be used to streamline the setup for multiple repositories.

  1. Jenkins Build Example: A minimal Jenkins build example was provided, detailing how a GitHub webhook could trigger it.

- used MidJourney to generate an initial teaser image for the project
