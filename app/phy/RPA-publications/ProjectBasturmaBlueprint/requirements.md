# **UiPath Project Build Pipeline: Requirements Document**

### **Purpose**

This document delineates the requirements for setting up a Jenkins-based Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline tailored specifically for building, testing, and deploying UiPath projects.

### **Scope**

The solution outlined pertains specifically to UiPath projects, integrating with Jenkins for automation and GitHub for source control, culminating in deployment to UiPath Orchestrator.

### **Overview**

The proposed Jenkins pipeline is tailored to facilitate an efficient build and deployment process for UiPath projects. The pipeline leverages a multi-stage approach, seamlessly transitioning through initialization, review and approval, project build, and post-build operations.

### **Core Requirements**

1. **Build UiPath Projects**:

   - Integrate seamlessly with GitHub repositories containing UiPath projects.
   - Streamline the build process, accounting for UiPath's unique project structure and dependencies.

2. **Environment Parameterization**:

   - Allow configuration and parameterization for various build environmentsâ€”development, staging, production, etc.
   - Provide flexibility to select target Orchestrator environments during build initiation.

3. **Code Review Mechanism**:

   - Implement an integrated review and approval system.
   - Ensure that only reviewed and approved code transitions to the build stage.

4. **Code Quality Check**:

   - Conduct thorough quality checks post-review to validate code standards and best practices.
   - Integrate with third-party tools, if necessary, to achieve a comprehensive quality assessment.

5. **Automated Testing**:

   - Run automated tests specific to UiPath workflows post-build.
   - Ensure functional validation and catch potential issues before deployment.

6. **Publish to Orchestrator**:

   - Deploy to the specified Orchestrator environment (test or production) based on the parameters set during the build initiation.
   - Ensure seamless integration and deployment, maintaining the integrity of the UiPath package.

7. **Notifications**:

   - Implement notification mechanisms at critical junctures of the pipeline.
   - Notify relevant stakeholders upon success, failure, or any required intervention.

8. **Documentation & Reporting**:
   - Auto-generate comprehensive documentation post-build, detailing the process, changes made, and any detected issues.
   - Maintain transparency and provide stakeholders with a concise audit trail.

### **Non-functional Requirements**

- **Scalability**: The pipeline should be scalable to accommodate an increasing number of projects.
- **Security**: Secure integration points, especially during the transfer of code and deployment processes.
- **Maintainability**: Ensure that the pipeline components are modular and can be updated independently.

### **Conclusion**

By addressing these requirements, the pipeline will ensure that UiPath projects are built, tested, and deployed efficiently and reliably, incorporating best practices and ensuring high standards of quality.
