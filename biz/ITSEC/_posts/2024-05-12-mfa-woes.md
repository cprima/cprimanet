the distilled objectives for SMS forwarding in your setup:

Enhance Privacy: Enable the receipt of SMS messages without using your primary mobile number, protecting your main number from being shared and stored by others who might accept less secure data processing terms.

Increase Accessibility: Ensure that you can receive SMS messages for various services (e.g., hotel check-in codes, two-factor authentication) without needing to carry your primary smartphone, which has heightened privacy settings and restrictions.

Remote Manageability: Move away from a system that relies on a rooted smartphone for SMS forwarding, which cannot be remotely troubleshooted, to a more robust and manageable system using an LTE router.

Reliability: Establish a more reliable SMS forwarding mechanism that can operate independently of your primary devices, ensuring consistent availability of SMS-based services.

Integration with Existing Infrastructure: Leverage your familiarity and preference for OpenWRT-enabled devices to ensure that the new SMS forwarding solution integrates seamlessly with your existing network infrastructure.

These objectives focus on improving the security, accessibility, and efficiency of handling SMS communications, aligning with broader goals of maintaining privacy and technical control.

LTE Router: For reliable SMS forwarding, especially for receiving SMS without carrying your primary smartphone. An LTE router can use a multi-SIM setup to clone your public mobile number, which is essential for receiving SMS from services that require it, such as hotel check-ins or 2FA.

Multi SIM Card: A secondary SIM card that clones your public mobile number, which will be inserted into the LTE router to receive SMS messages.

Rooted Smartphone: Currently used for SMS forwarding, though you plan to replace this setup with an LTE router. The rooted smartphone allows for greater control over the device, bypassing standard configurations that might compromise privacy.

Network Cables and Accessories: Including Ethernet cables for connecting devices where necessary and power adapters for the routers.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is crucial for enhancing security, but it can definitely come with its set of frustrations. Some common woes include:

Inconvenience: Having to always have access to a second device or token can be a hassle, especially if you're in a rush or the device isn't readily available.

Device Dependency: If your authentication method relies on a specific device like a smartphone, losing that device, battery issues, or connectivity problems can lock you out of your accounts.

Setup Complexity: Setting up MFA can sometimes be confusing, particularly for those who aren't tech-savvy. This can lead to errors that make the process even more frustrating.

False Denials: Sometimes, MFA systems can mistakenly deny access to the legitimate user, particularly if there are issues with time synchronization between devices or inaccurate input of authentication codes.

Limited Accessibility: In some regions or situations, receiving SMS or using authentication apps might not be feasible, limiting the practicality of MFA for some users.

Despite these challenges, the security benefits of MFA are significant, making it a worthwhile tradeoff for many. To mitigate some of these issues, organizations and users can explore alternative authentication methods, like biometrics or physical keys, which might offer a smoother experience.

To address the common issues with multi-factor authentication, particularly when dealing with connectivity and device dependency, leveraging an industrial 4G LTE router combined with a multi-SIM setup and SMS forwarding can be highly effective. Here's a breakdown of how each component can help mitigate MFA challenges:

Industrial 4G LTE Router:

Reliable Connectivity: These routers provide a stable and robust internet connection, which is crucial for receiving time-sensitive MFA prompts via the internet, such as push notifications or through authentication apps.
Fallback Internet: In areas where primary internet connections are unreliable, these routers can serve as a reliable backup, ensuring that MFA mechanisms that require internet access are always available.
Multi SIM with Second SIM Card from Another GSM Carrier:

Redundancy: Having SIM cards from different carriers ensures connectivity even if one carrier's network goes down. This is particularly useful in critical applications where being locked out of an account due to carrier issues is unacceptable.
Wider Coverage: Different carriers may have better coverage in different areas. Using multiple carriers can expand the geographical range in which a user can receive SMS or mobile data signals without interruption.
SMS Forwarding:

Accessibility: If the primary device for receiving SMS is unavailable or out of service, SMS forwarding allows these messages to be redirected to another device. This can be crucial if the primary device is lost, stolen, or simply out of battery.
Convenience: Users can receive MFA SMS messages on any device they choose, which can be particularly useful if they have multiple devices or if their primary device isn’t always on hand.
Implementation Tips:

Security: Ensure that the SMS forwarding and the multi-SIM setup are secure. Use encryption where possible and restrict access to these systems to prevent unauthorized interception of MFA codes.
Carrier Choice: Choose carriers based on reliability and coverage in the regions most often frequented by the users. Consider including at least one carrier known for extensive rural or remote area coverage.
Router Configuration: Set up the router with security in mind, updating its firmware regularly and using strong, unique passwords. Configuring failover settings will help in switching seamlessly between SIMs/cards based on signal strength and network availability.
By integrating these technologies, you can substantially reduce the risk of MFA-related lockouts while maintaining the security benefits that MFA provides.
