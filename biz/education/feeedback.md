You're lightyears ahead of other folks that attempt comparable works. Don't have a ton of feedback other than by minute 8 I was a little tired of hearing that background music and had to rewind at times because I was thinking about it rather than the content. I think one of the chief problems I notice in tutorial videos (besides poor dialogue) is the tendency to make a video that says, "I'm gonna show you how to do X. Click here, type here, click here, click here, type here, click here. Then click here. Then type here. Click here and here, then click here. You're done! Easy, right?" and people who are watching tutorial videos aren't necessarily looking for where to click, but also, why to click and why not click something else instead. I literally quit a UiPath deep dive that was scheduled this morning because 15 minutes in, all I was doing was watching someone "Click here" and not learning anything.
