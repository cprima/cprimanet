# Why Do We Care About Student Learning Outcomes?

## SLOs guide the decisions you make when designing or re-designing a course

Crafting clear and measurable student learning outcomes is probably the most important step in designing or re-designing a course. Defining what students will be able to do, represent, or produce as a result of successfully completing a course will help you identify the course content and learning activities best suited for your course. Having a clear vision of the student learning outcomes will also guide you with identifying meaningful assessments to determine if students are meeting the learning outcomes.

## SLOs communicate the "why" for taking your course to students

- When shared in the course catalog, students can find courses that best meet their interests and learning goals
- Helps increase student awareness of their own learning as they take a course

## SLOs are important for program assessment

SLOs are used for program assessment by linking course outcomes to your program outcomes, curricular maps can reveal gaps, redundancies and overlaps within a program

# Fink’s Taxonomy of Significant Learning

Dee Fink, in 2003, introduced a taxonomy of significant learning that integrates cognitive and affective areas and adds a meta-cognitive component.  His 6 types of significant learning are interactive but not hierarchical and would be used selectively depending on the learning outcome desired. They are:

- Foundational Knowledge: understanding and remembering information and ideas
- Application: skills, critical thinking, creative thinking, practical thinking, and managing projects
- Integration: connecting information, ideas, perspectives, people, or realms of life
- Human Dimension: learning about oneself and others
- Caring: developing new feelings, interests, and values
- Learning How to Learn: becoming a better student, inquiring about a subject, becoming a self-directed learner 

# Tips for Writing SLOs

1. Avoid vague and non-observable verbs.
   - For example, it is difficult to measure whether someone has “become familiar with” a particular tool or “appreciates” a genre of music. Use a more specific verb. If “understanding” is sought, think more closely about what students should to be able to do or produce as a result of their “understanding.” 
1. Use observable action verbs
   - Outcomes should be something students “do” and are measurable. 
   - Coming up with the right verb can be challenging, and sometimes an existing SLO can be revised in a much more effective way by simply using the right verb. This sheet provides suggested action verbs that correspond with Fink’s taxonomy. 
1. Outcomes should be important
   - There is a clear connection to the student’s life and/or their future career path
Are rigorous yet realistic
