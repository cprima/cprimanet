# Preview: Key Takeaways

Good sound for webinars or video conferences starts at the beginning of an audio signal chain with the *room sound* and the *microphone*. The room sound *is* greatly influenced by *reflective*, absorptive and *diffusive* qualities of the materials within. The microphone's *polar pattern* and frequency response feeds on *mic level* into the production workflow. A dedicated *audio interface* solves the analog-digital conversion in *hardware*; by the way acceptable hardware involved *is not* wireless. Distributing to YouTube demands for tight control of the normalized loudness and true peak, which can be achieved with compressor, limiter and e.g. the software Youlean Loudness Meter. While doing so an applied EQ ("equalizer") *curve* may "fix in post" some deficiencies at the beginning of the audio signal chain. Whether that happens analog at the beginning of the signal chain or digitally in post-production: Audio recording is best understood on the basis of electrical signals and their visual representations like *waveforms* and frequency spectrums.

## Get in Contact

I love to connect with like-minded people and invite you to [Connect on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cprima/). As I do not sell anything I won't pitch to you! ;) <!-- [![LinkedIn](/biz/marketing/images/ConnectOnLinkedIn.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cprima/) -->

As this event is a hobby of mine I tend to frequent the site only outside Central European Working hours though.

In the past months I posted weekly snippets and short posts about automation, do-it-yourself, RPA and all things audio-video.

# Recording

YouTuber Anders Jensen asked on LinkedIn if someone could help to improve the audio of his YouTube video and livestreams.

Well, I have repeated professional testimonials that I like to help other people fulfilling their potential.

Join Anders Jensen and me on a live session where
- we are going to wrap up first improvements for his video channel and his teaching business
- I share the condensed learning of my past 2 years
- and paint a roadmap for future improvements.

Participants will 
- be able to derive actionable ideas from this journey for their own improvements
- distinguish elements of good audio to apply to their own online presence
- rank these by difficulty and affordability
- recognize basic terms and concepts of audio engineering
