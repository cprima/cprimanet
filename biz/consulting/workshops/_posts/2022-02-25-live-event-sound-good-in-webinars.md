## Get in Contact

I love to connect with like-minded people and invite you to [Connect on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cprima/). As I do not sell anything I won't pitch to you! ;) <!-- [![LinkedIn](/biz/marketing/images/ConnectOnLinkedIn.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cprima/) -->

As this event is a hobby of mine I tend to frequent the site only outside Central European Working hours though.

In the past months I posted weekly snippets and short posts about automation, do-it-yourself, RPA and all things audio-video.

YouTuber Anders Jensen asked on LinkedIn if someone could help to improve the audio of his YouTube video and livestreams.

Well, I have repeated professional testimonials that I like to help other people fulfilling their potential.

Join Anders Jensen and me on a live session where
- we are going to wrap up first improvements for his video channel and his teaching business
- I share the condensed learning of my past 2 years
- and paint a roadmap for future improvements.

Participants will 
- be able to derive actionable ideas from this journey for their own improvements
- distinguish elements of good audio to apply to their own online presence
- rank these by difficulty and affordability
- recognize basic terms and concepts of audio engineering
