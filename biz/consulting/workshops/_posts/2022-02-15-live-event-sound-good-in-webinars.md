## Get in Contact

I love to connect with like-minded people and invite you to [![LinkedIn](/biz/marketing/images/ConnectOnLinkedIn.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cprima/). As I do not sell anything I won't pitch to you! ;)

As this event is a hobby of mine I tend to frequent the site only outside Central European Working hours though.

In the past months I posted weekly snippets and short posts about automation, do-it-yourself, RPA and all things audio-video.
