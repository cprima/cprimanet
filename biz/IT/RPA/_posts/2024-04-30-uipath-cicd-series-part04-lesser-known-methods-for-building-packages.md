üõ†Ô∏è Today: Exploring lesser-known methods for building packages.

I cannot stress enough how insightful it was for me when I discovered the UiPath Jenkins plugin sourcode, specifically the UiPathPack.java and Utility.java files. And also https://docs.uipath.com/test-suite/automation-suite/2023.4/user-guide/jobs
üî¥ THE major takeaway: Using uipcli.exe it is possible to build and even deploy to Orchestrator!

The uipcli.exe

- does not require a UiPath licence
- can be downloaded ad hoc from a nupkg packages (see attached document for sample code)

It is best documented in the Test Suite docs: https://docs.uipath.com/test-suite/automation-suite/2023.4/user-guide/uipath-command-line-interface

To ease into CI/CD pipelines I recommend to place uipcli.exe locally where a PowerShell script can call it, and write a few lines into a ps1 file to execute it. It capabilities are

- running workflow analyzer
- build a nupkg
- deploy to Orchestrator
- run tests
- and more

Such a minimal implementation will also tell if it works in your environment (building packages needs network access to nuget feeds, for example.)

I was able to successfully use uipcli.exe on a personal, public repo on github.com, on an ""ephemeral"" runner. (An ""ephemeral runner"" is a temporary virtual environment that is provisioned for running specific tasks or jobs and is disposed of after use, ensuring a clean, isolated setup for each execution.)

üëâ This is how to run Workflow Analyzer with uipcli.exe
& 'C:\Program Files\uipcli\tools\uipcli.exe' package analyze .\project.json --resultPath path\to\uipath-workflow-analyzer_results.json

üëâ And this is how to build a process package with a supplied version string:
& 'C:\Program Files\uipcli\tools\uipcli.exe' package pack .\project.json --output "".\path\to\output"" --traceLevel Verbose --disableTelemetry --outputType Process

Reading the project.json it is trivial to build dynamically a Process or Library, the key designOptions.outputType contains

- Process
- Library
- or others

And because the projectVersion was already incremented as per Semantic Versioning rules with code published earlier in this series, uipcli.exe brings us one step further in the CI/CD pipeline for UiPath RPA.

Remember the DevOps infinity symbol? Leveraging ""CODE"" version control and a few lines of PowerShell code the ""BUILD"" phase is also covered.

Next step will one step back: Git is much more than file snapshots, and with the additional capabilities of GitHub on top the structured, rule-based and repetitive digital task of building UiPath RPA packages can be automated. Sounds familiar? That's why I consider this series as advocating to ""eat our own dogfood"".
