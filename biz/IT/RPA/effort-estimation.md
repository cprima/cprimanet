problem statement

RPA development one-shot "no maintenance"
top-down and bottom-up calculation
beware of false precision
_estimation_ needs verification, validation and ex post review



efforts:
- cost
- capacity


RPA "build-and-forget" with infrequent incident rate and low change requests: unlike a product almost no ongoing maintenance and typically zero product backlog. Hence a low fit of agile estimation techniques (planning poker, dot voting, complexity buckets)


pre-sales effort for effort estimation: produce valid input for build project and book efforts later


triple constraint

- cost
- scope
- time
