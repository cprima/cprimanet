- Use the Sun Calculator at https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/germany/wolfsburg for start or end location(s)
- Civil Twilight used to be defined as the time when a person could read a newspaper without artificial light. Since then the definition became more geometric, but is still a good indicator of visibility
- depending of the coordinates the reverse direction of a route on the same day might bring 20 minutes of differences in usable daylight
- daylight saving time and timezones make for a suprising "real noon", which has significant effect on the temparature curve over the day
- sunrise and sunset have a surprising amount of fluctuation, to look up (or even calculate) their exact time removes and uncertainty. On multi-day or multi-week bicycle tours this enables the planning of the next day.
