# Restarting

## Habits an routines

Here's why habits and routines are so important in endurance training:

- Consistency: Endurance training relies heavily on building and maintaining a consistent training regimen. Consistency is key for gradual adaptations in cardiovascular fitness, muscular endurance, and overall performance.

- Progression: By following a weekly routine, athletes can progressively increase the duration, intensity, or volume of their workouts. This gradual progression is essential for improving endurance and preventing overuse injuries.

- Time Management: Establishing a routine helps athletes manage their time effectively. Knowing when and how to fit workouts into a weekly schedule ensures that training doesn't interfere with other responsibilities.

- Recovery: A well-structured routine includes designated rest days and recovery periods. These breaks are crucial for allowing the body to repair and adapt to training stress.

- Psychological Benefits: Routines provide a sense of structure and predictability. This can reduce stress and anxiety associated with training and help athletes stay motivated over the long term.

- Goal Achievement: Routines are aligned with specific training goals. Whether it's preparing for a marathon, triathlon, or long-distance cycling event, consistent training habits are essential for achieving those goals.

- Habit Formation: Regular training can lead to the formation of positive habits. Over time, exercise becomes a natural and integrated part of daily life.

- Accountability: Having a routine can create a sense of accountability. Athletes are more likely to stick to their training plan when it's part of their regular schedule.

To establish effective habits and routines in endurance training, consider the following tips:

- Set clear and achievable training goals.
- Develop a weekly training plan that includes a mix of workouts (e.g., long runs, tempo runs, interval sessions).
- Prioritize rest and recovery days.
- Create a training schedule that fits your lifestyle and daily commitments.
- Track your progress and adjust your routine as needed.
- Stay flexible and adaptable in case unexpected events disrupt your schedule.
- By making endurance training a habit and integrating it into your weekly routine, you can maximize your performance potential and enjoy the long-term benefits of improved fitness and overall well-being.

Focus areas by month:

- August 2023 Habit Reformation: For a runner who is restarting their training, reactivating positive habits established in the past is crucial. With time and consistent effort, exercise once again seamlessly integrates into their daily life, becoming a second nature routine.
- September 2023 Biomechanical Reconditioning: Biomechanical reconditioning is the process of fine-tuning the intricate interplay between your muscles, tendons, ligaments, and bones to optimize movement and performance.
- October 2023 Training Rhythm Standardization: Establishing a consistent training schedule. It involves developing a weekly routine that includes a mix of specific workouts, rest days, and recovery periods.

## Biomechanical Reconditioning

Biomechanical reconditioning is the process of fine-tuning the intricate interplay between your muscles, tendons, ligaments, and bones to optimize movement and performance. Whether you're a seasoned athlete or new to a sport, this concept underscores the importance of refining your body's mechanical efficiency. It involves addressing imbalances, improving posture, and enhancing stability and flexibility to reduce the risk of injuries and elevate your athletic prowess. Biomechanical reconditioning extends beyond the realm of exercise, impacting everyday movements and posture, ultimately enhancing your overall quality of life. Whether you're striving for peak performance or simply seeking a more functional and pain-free body, biomechanical reconditioning is a holistic approach that fosters a harmonious relationship between your body and the physical demands you place upon it.

Here are some strategies and exercises to consider:

- Gait awareness
- Strength Training
- Flexibility and Mobility
- Footwear Assessment
- Cadence Awareness
- Running Drills
- Posture Awareness
- Gradual Progression
- Rest and Recovery

Biomechanical reconditioning takes time and consistent effort. It's a holistic approach that involves improving the efficiency of your body's movement patterns and reducing the risk of injuries. By incorporating these strategies into your training routine, you can work toward achieving better biomechanics and enhancing your running performance.

## October 2023 Training Rhythm Standardization

In October 2023, the focus is on "Training Rhythm Standardization." The plan includes running on established routes from September 2023, repeating selected workout sessions for specific training goals, tracking run durations, and calculating the weekly TRIMP (Training Impulse) value using heart rate data. In addition, nutritional optimizations and the establishment of a core strength training routine are essential components of this month's approach.

# From Laps to Apps: A Returnee's View on Running in the Digital Era

Returning from a 15-10 year hiatus, I'm restarting my running training. I can't help but notice:

- Training sessions are widely shared on social media nowadays, having a huge impact on motivation and community building.
- This sharing is enabled by watches and/or smartphones.
- Platforms like Strava, Garmin Connect, Runkeeper, Polar Flow, and Runalyze provide data analysis and social features, like comments, kudos, and "gamification" with badges, challenges or milestones.
- Devices and platforms are actively suggesting training sessions, although self-coached runners still seem to follow plans by Daniels, Pfitzinger, and others.

But I also can't help but notice a lack of forward-looking features: Hardly ever are the upcoming planned sessions shared or even implemented on these platforms. I have found so far only Final Surge, with its target group of online coaches, offering what I remember from my youth: A weekly calendar with upcoming sessions. I understand that runners might not want to share plans because of:

- Privacy concerns
- Flexibility to change plans
- Wisely avoiding "armchair coaches"
- A certain focus on "results"

Nevertheless, I think that sharing planned sessions would provide even more:

- Community support
- Inspiration
- Accountability

Or maybe I am missing out on features of the platforms I mentioned above? I'd be happy to learn about them.

Maybe my situation is transitory, but at the moment "I don't care about the last session" because I need to carefully manage the training load for the next 3-10 days.

Would you share your planned sessions? Why or why not?
