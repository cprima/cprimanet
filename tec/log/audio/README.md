"…things are not loud enough…
a limier allows you to bring up the avage elvel
because you are limiting the peaks
so you reduce the peaks in the limiter and then you turn everything up

a limiter is a great way to just make the overall programm louder"

I would to a compression 2:1 ratio 16/20dB

then a lmiter 1-2 dB down

Mic into ATEM Mini (Pro)
On the channel gentle expander 10dB gain reduction
and a little bit of compression on mic bus

try to have a great preamp for the microphone and
try to get it to line level as fast as possible

expanion vs. compression settings

An expander takes quiet sounds and makes them quieter. But everything above the threshold is untouched and passes through at unity gain.

So the threshold is the decision level of loud sounds above that number 
and mine is set at minus 30dB
sounds above that are untouched and sounds below that get turned down.
Range is how much they get turned down
mine is set to minus 10dB
so a maximum of mnus 10 dB
the ratio is how steep that slope is of turing things down
and the nattack and release are tinming
so attack is going to be fairly short 
so that when I talk the exander goes away.
Hold will keep taht open at unity gain for a longer period of time I have mone set to 500 ms
and I have a very long release for voice so that takes 2 seconds for that 10db gain reduction to come in.

So that in between my words when I am talking i am staying
unitiy gain

and when I stop talking you hear things drop

An expander expands the dynamic range
the range between the louds and the softs.
So it takes quiet stuff and makes it quieter.

A compressor takes loud stuff and makes it quieter
which therefore makes less of a difference and compresses the dynamic range.

Why do we always turn stuff down?
Because then we don't clip anything.

So both of them wirk by turning things down.

The expander turns the quiets down,
compressor turns the louds down.
