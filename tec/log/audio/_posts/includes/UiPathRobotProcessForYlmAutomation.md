#{{ include.headingmodifier }} UiPath Robot Process for YLM Automation

My favorite software for loudness analysis, Youlean Loudness Meter, cannot be automated out-of-the-box. But fortunately any type of GUI automation can be done not just with software from test automation but it is a core feature of RPA software, Robotic Process Automation. And with the aim to analyze the YouTube channel of Anders Jensen, RPA developer and Most Valuable Professional in forum of the software vendor "UiPath" -- what would be a better fit than UiPath's CV activities Computer Vision activities.

UiPath is the world's leading RPA software company, started in 2015 in Bukarest, Romania and has since seen a rockeetship growth.
Part of the capabilities of the development tool "UiPath Studio" are the Computer Visicion activities. Even such hard to automate GUIs like the one of Youlean Loudness Meter can be automated by Computer Vision's AI-enhanced Click, Type into or dropdown select capabilities. All without having to resort to image scraping.

An efficient anylssis of Anders Jensen's 350+ video was impossible without this UiPath Robot Process!
