#{{ include.headingmodifier }} Audacity and Room Reverb


A measurable property of the room is its reverberation time, which can be measured according to ISO standards -- or performed with simple tools which is good enough in our context.

Most common method is to measure the RT60 which is the time in seconds until a loud sound decays by 60 decibels.


In Audacity, create a new project and add a track.

Start recording and make a short, loud sound that just does not clip, for example by clapping with the hand-

You will see very distinctive waveforms.


Crop to a single one of the claps, zoom into just the waveform and in the timeline you will see the farctions of a second that it tokk the sound to die down.


Then do a few improvements, and measure again!
