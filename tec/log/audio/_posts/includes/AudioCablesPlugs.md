#{{ include.headingmodifier }} Audio Cables and Plugs

In this picture we see a variation of commonly used audio cables.

They can be categorized by the number of signal lines, abbreviated by t for tip, r for ring and s for sleeve.

On the very left we have a 3.5mm TRRS cable with 4 signal lilnes, suitable to transmit a headphone with microphone.

Then we have a very handy adapter from 3.5mm to 6.3mm

Next a 6.3mm TS cable

followed by another 3.5mm TRRS headphone-mic cable.

the last 3 are a cable from 3.5mm TRS to left and right RCA jacks.


The most common cable for microphones are those with an 3-pin XLR jack.

They carry the microphone level into an audio interface and should be kept rather short.

By the way, many audio interfaces have so-called combo jacks, which can take a XLR cable or a 6.3mm cable. In the latter case the audio interface expects line level.
