#{{ include.headingmodifier }} Audio Signal Chain

To sound good in webinars and on YouTube many small adjustments need to be made,
and it is best to identify the components involved -- so they can be adressed individually.

For the sake of completeness the room where we record should be put on the list first. As it will have sounds coming in from the outside, and sound reflecting within its walls.

The we obviously will talk into a microphone, one of the many types and models. A microphone converts soundwaves to analog audio signals.

The cable connecting it will have 2 or three connections, and the connector will determine where we can plug it in.
AND the cable will give us a hint about the level.

Within the cable run there is the possibility to insert an additional microphone pre-amplifier.

Preferrably a standalone audio interface will give us the microphone pre-amplification, knobs to turn the gain level, and will transform the analog signal into a digital.

By the way, a USB microphone "just" has a built-in audio interface.

On the computer that an audio interface is connected to many things can happen to the signal, like

- processing it with a digital workflow
- embedding it with video
- streaming it to YouTube
- storing it to in lossless or lossy formats

The signal chain does not end there though, let's keep in mind that the viewer or listener will
