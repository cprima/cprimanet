#{{ include.headingmodifier }} Youlean Loudness Meter

Youlean Loudness Meter is an application or plugin to measure the correct loudness levels for upload to Spotify, YouTube, and more.
It comes in a free and Pro version and is developed by a great guy named Julijan Nikolic, that's where the software got its name from.

It shows the loudness as both short-term as well as intergrated -- that is over the diration of the whole file.

And it analysis the true peak levels to indicate dangerously high levels.

It features an export of the generated graphs, not just for the loudness but also the dynamics -- which is of use in music production.

I use YLM as an additional Zoom, Teams or Skype participant to monitor the loudness of all participants.
