#{{ include.headingmodifier }} Audio Signal Levels

Using a microphone with a computer is actually an interesting mix: Any digital recording actually starts and ends in the Analog Domain of the physical world, and digital is only the middle part. Both the microphone and the loudspeaker are analog devices.

And a microphone produces at its core a continous electrical signal, done by converting vibrations into electrical energy, and a very low signal that is: The result is an induced voltage of a few millivolt -- that is thousandths of a volt. This is very LOW!

In our webinars and YouTube videos signals are passed between audio equipment on

- microphone level and
- line level (in its consumer line level variant)

It is the functionality of

- either a pre-amplifier and
- the audio interface

to raise the mic level to line level, which is suitable to pass signals between equipment.

Sometimes we see on equipment the label "instrument level", this is slightly below consumer line level.

All this gives us a hint that a microphone is best understood with the mindset of an electrical engineer.
