#{{ include.headingmodifier }} Room Acoustics, Reverberation Time and Clap Test

The journey to improve the audio quality of a recorded narration for webinars or in videoconferences does not start with buying equipment. Because equipment is used inside a room and the room is where it starts.

The requirements to record for webinars are very similar to those of the voice actors, or voice over artists. And they are quite different from music producers or audio mixers. And quite different from high fidelity music listeners. So this kind of narrows down from whom to take advice from.
Another good source of advice are audio engineers in churches, by the way. And with a bit of training our own ears are another authoritative judge!

Within the room there will be direct sound and reflected sound from the walls and surfaces. The physical properties of these surfaces make or break a good room acoustic! Only so-called anechoc chambers have no reflected sound and they are not a good thing to strive for, by the way.

The reflected sound will hit our microphone again and decrease the quality of our recording. This reflected sound is THE most important aspect that needs to be controlled. Worst case is to sit between two hard walls which reflect our spoken word multiple times into the microphone until it dies down in volume.

And let's not forget that there is a reflective ceiling, too!

To reduce reflections both absorption and diffusion will improve the room acoustics. Examples for absorptive materials are:

- acoustic foam
- furniture
- curtains
- rugs
- acoustic bass traps
and of course
- sound blankets

Diffusive materials are

- bookshelves
- sound diffusors

A measurable property of the room is its reverberation time, which can be measured in according to ISO standards -- or performed with simple tools which is good enough in our context.

First, what is exactly meant with reverberation time?

Reverberation is the acumulated reflection of sound. It is what we hear in a bathroom.
Reveberation time is the time it needs to fade away.

Most common method is to measure the RT60 which is the time in seconds until a loud sound decays by 60 decibels.

All this is another way of saying: Do a clap test, there is even an app for this!

Either the app or our own recording with our existing microphone into a software that displays a waveform will give us a measurement in seconds.

Then we do a few improvements, and measure again, and listen to our recording again.

In my room I have both hard and absorbant materials. But as the sound of my voice does not bounce back from the hard surfaces into the microphone I have not negative effect by the hard wooden cupboard doors. So a good room for audio recording does not need to be covered in foam all around!

The biggest problem of my room is that the heating pipes transmit sound from the teenagers room underneath. Reverberation time does not fix THAT. Maybe I will give them a gamer's headset next christmas! ;)

Going by sich an (inofficial) RT60-like measurement means that it is easy to find out when to stop improving the room acoustic, and focus on other aspects of good audio in webinars!
