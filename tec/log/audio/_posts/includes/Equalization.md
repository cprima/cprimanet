#{{ include.headingmodifier }} Equalization: Changes to the Frequency Spectrum

In the audio workflow there are no recipes but rather only strategies regarding equalization.

Getting the right microphone for the voice and recording it well should mean little or no EQ is needed.

But if there are unwanted frequencies they could be cut. And if there is not enough of some other frequency its range could be boosted.

Any type of such work shold be done with at least studio-grade headphones.

And instead of following recipes from the internet the whole signal chain should be taken into consideration, for example the microphone's frequency response chart.

In the postprocessing workflow there could be two equalization steps:

- After a gate
- there might be EQ cuts
- then the compression
- followed by EQ boosts
- and finally a limiter and/or normalization to distribution loudness
