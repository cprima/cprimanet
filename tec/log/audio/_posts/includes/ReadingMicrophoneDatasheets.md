For the novice a less readable part of datasheets of microphones might be the graphs about polar patterns and frequency responses. But that part is sooo important!

##{{ include.headingmodifier }} Polar Patterns

The polar pattern depicts the sencsitivity to sounds arriving from different angles. A polar graph uses angles as reference system, different from the more ubiquitous cartesian graphs with their x, z and mazbe z axis.
The practitioner can read from a microphone's polar pattern graph how to best position the micriphone so that it does not pick up for example typing noise from the keyboard.

##{{ include.headingmodifier }} Frequency Responses

With the microphone at the very beginning of a recording signal chain it is highly advisable before doing any later EQ "equalisation" changes to the frequency spectrum to study what the microphone did apply to the frequencies at the very beginning. If the practitioner knows that the microphone has what is commonly referred to as presence boost in the (roughly) 3 kHz to 6 kHz range: Then there will hardly be any need to further boost that range in post production.

The polar patterns also show in raw data what otherwise might get marketing terms applied to, like "Exciter" oder "ContourFX".
