#{{ include.headingmodifier }} OBS Multi-Track Recording

OBS is a widely used screen recording and streaming software, and is great for not just recording the video part of a pre-produced webinar but is also capable of multi track audio recording.

In the OBS settings for Audio each recording device can be selected or disabled individually. So there is a clear  distinction between the audio interface and the system sound.

But to fully utilize this each device should be recorded to an individual track. This is setup via the Audio Mixer and a right-click on a cogwheel icon in the adcancded audio properties.

Best practise is to record all devices mixed down to track one, and then each device into an own track.

Later in postproduction each track can be adjusted individually.
