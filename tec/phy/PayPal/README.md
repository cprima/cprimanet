addresses at checkout: "hidden addresses"

> if you only see the additional addresses when you check out and not on your PayPal account Settings, this would mean that the addresses displayed are hidden addresses. These types of addresses are added when you make a guest purchase, or if you add an address at checkout without adding it to your PayPal account. As these are not registered accounts, you won't have the option to delete them. However, you can submit a request to have them removed to our Customer Service.
