Introducing UiPath Test Manager

Duration: 5 min
What is Test Manager?

You probably know UiPath Test Suite, our product bundle for application and RPA testing, done manually, automatically or in a hybrid setup. Each component serves a specific purpose, for example automated test case creation in Studio Pro or automated test execution by test robots.

Test Manager is the component used for managing the test process and the different types of objects and their hierarchy, as well as for integrating with third-party ALM tools.


Why you need it?

The act of testing covers an extensive set of activities, including manual and automated test case creation and execution, reporting, requirement and defect management, CI/CD integration, just to name a few.

One of the biggest challenges is to make testing an integral part of the development process. This requires linking software development assets (e.g. user stories, epics) to software testing assets (e.g. test cases, test results), as well as a solution to manage and synchronize all the data generated in both processes. Test Manager is the component serving these purposes.

How does it work?

Test Manager is has two sub-components:

The Test Manager Hub

The main purpose of this component is to integrate the UiPath Test Suite with third-party ALM tools. Through its flexible connector architecture, it can be used to integrate any ALM tool that provides a compatible API in order to:


bullet
Integrate with third-party test management solutions.


bullet
Import stories, requirements or similar artifacts in Test Manager.


bullet
Push defects to the third-party tools, together with log information and screenshots.

The Test Manager web application

The web application allows you to manage your test process and test objects by:


bullet
Managing requirements and assigning test cases to them.


bullet
Creating and documenting manual test cases.


bullet
Linking automated test cases between Studio Pro and Test Manager.


bullet
Executing manual and automated test sets.


bullet
Managing the test execution data, reports and KPIs.



The Test Manager User Interface

Duration: 15 min
At the end of this lesson you should be able to:

Make use of all the options in the Test Manager user interface.
Create new projects in Test Manager.
Identify the modules of a test project in Test Manager.
Create and configure custom fields.
