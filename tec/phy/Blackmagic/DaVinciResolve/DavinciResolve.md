bg music normalized to -30dB, then on channel reduced by another -10dB

Youlean Loudness Meter, Youlean Loudness Meter, Youlean Loudness Meter, YLM, YLM and repeat

done
Fusion mouse highlighter
Adjustment clip zoom effect (mind the stack level of the track)
each chapter in compound clip (hides cuts and repairs)
bg music covering slient (makes audio cleaning easier)
RetimeControls to speed-up, slow-down or freeze a screenrecording (no cuts needed!)
script-first approach
publishing hub on GitLab (wiki)

bad:
YouTube chapter thumbnails round to a second -- must cut to the seconds
bars of bg music not in sync to cuts, must cut to 4/8/16 bars
no transitions
zoom and mouse in main timeline, not in compund clips

todo
ticker lower third for explanations
asset handling for series of videos
