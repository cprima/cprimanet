# Leveraging GitHub's Camo Image Proxy for Jenkins Badge Integration

### Introduction

GitHub repositories frequently showcase badges in their README files, displaying status indicators like build success or test coverage. A popular choice for CI/CD is Jenkins, which offers badges showing the build status. However, integrating these badges from Jenkins into a GitHub repository can expose the Jenkins server's URL. Enter GitHub's Camo Image Proxy.

### Understanding Camo

GitHub utilizes Camo, an image proxying service, to serve external images over HTTPS. This has two primary purposes:

1. Ensure that all content on GitHub is delivered over HTTPS, preserving the security guarantees of the platform.
2. Protect user privacy by preventing direct connections to external servers, thereby hiding users' details such as IP addresses.

### The Badge Integration Challenge

When integrating Jenkins build badges into a GitHub README, the direct Jenkins server URL is visible in the image source. For organizations or individuals who want to obfuscate their infrastructure details, this can be a concern.

### Using Camo for Badge Integration

By observing how GitHub proxies badge images, one can notice that the image's direct URL is transformed into a Camo URL. This new URL obfuscates the original source, serving as a potential method to keep the Jenkins server URL private.

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Insert the Jenkins badge URL in the GitHub README as you typically would.
2. After rendering on GitHub, inspect the image element to obtain the Camo URL.
3. Replace the original Jenkins badge URL in the README with the extracted Camo URL.

### Implications

While the method seems straightforward, there are some aspects to consider:

1. **Dependency**: This approach relies on GitHub's internal services. Any changes in the way GitHub uses Camo could render the URL ineffective.
2. **Double Proxying**: The image is effectively being proxied twice. This is not the primary use of Camo and might introduce slight delays.
3. **Lack of Transparency**: For collaborators or external developers, the Camo URL offers no indication of its source. This can make troubleshooting or modifications challenging.
4. **Migration Concerns**: If repositories are moved to a platform other than GitHub, the Camo URL will not function.

### Conclusion

GitHub's Camo Image Proxy provides an intriguing solution for those looking to obfuscate their Jenkins badge URL in README files. While the benefits of privacy are evident, developers should weigh these against potential pitfalls related to dependencies and transparency. Like all technical solutions, it's essential to align the method with the project's specific requirements and constraints.
