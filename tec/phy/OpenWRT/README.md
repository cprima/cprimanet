hen you perform a sysupgrade on an OpenWrt device, the additional packages you have installed are not preserved by default. Hereâ€™s what happens and what you can do to manage your installed packages:

What Happens After a Sysupgrade:
Firmware Overwrite: The sysupgrade process installs the new firmware image, which typically overwrites the existing system. This means any additional packages installed will be removed unless they are included in the new firmware image.

Configuration Files: If you choose to preserve settings during the sysupgrade (-c option in the command line or checking the "Keep settings" box in LuCI), most of your configuration files in /etc/config and some other specific directories will be retained. However, the binaries and data files of the additional packages will be lost.
