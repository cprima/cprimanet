#### Identifying Installed Component Versions on Jetson Linux OS

Once you have everything set up on your Jetson Linux OS, it's common to want to ensure which versions of various components are installed. While diving deep into the system might be a daunting task for those not acquainted with the command line, don't worry—I've got you covered. In this chapter, we'll go over simple commands and methods to help you identify the installed versions of key components.

To start, let's figure out which version of the **Jetson Linux Driver Package (L4T)** we have:
```bash
cat /etc/nv_tegra_release
```
Running this command will display details about the L4T version.

For those of you keen on understanding which **CUDA Toolkit** version is installed, here's a straightforward way:
```bash
nvcc --version
```
Executing the above will present the CUDA compiler version if CUDA has indeed been set up.

Determining the **cuDNN** version is slightly more intricate. Navigate to the directory where cuDNN resides, usually in `/usr/local/cuda/include/`. Once there, peek into the `cudnn.h` file:
```bash
cat /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn.h | grep CUDNN_MAJOR -A 2
```
This action will reveal the major, minor, and patch version of cuDNN.

To uncover the **TensorRT** version, the `dpkg` command is your friend (assuming you've welcomed TensorRT into your system via Debian packages):
```bash
dpkg -l | grep nvinfer
```

Regarding **DeepStream SDK**, you'll often find a version file sitting politely in its root directory. Glimpse into this file to discern the version:
```bash
cat /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-<version>/version
```

For **VisionWorks**, try this simple command which should reveal its version:
```bash
vw_version
```

For graphics enthusiasts wondering about their **OpenGL** version, this will do the trick:
```bash
glxinfo | grep "OpenGL version"
```
Just ensure you have `glxinfo` installed.

In terms of the **Multimedia API**, its version tends to echo the L4T version. So, by checking the L4T version, you'll get a good idea.

Finally, tools like **Nsight** might require you to launch the application's GUI or delve into its specific documentation to identify its version.

By the end of these steps, you'll have a comprehensive grasp of which component versions are actively working in your system. It always provides a sense of clarity, especially when troubleshooting or planning future updates. Happy tinkering!

## Modes of Operation

The NVIDIA Jetson Nano, like other members of the Jetson family, has different modes of operation which cater to various usage scenarios, ranging from development, flashing, and debugging to its regular runtime operation. The modes are essential for developers and users to manage, update, and troubleshoot the device.

1. **Normal Boot Mode (Run Mode)**:
   - This is the regular operational mode of the Jetson Nano. In this mode, the device boots up and runs the installed OS and applications.
   - Users can develop, test, and run their applications, including any deep learning or AI models, as intended.

2. **Recovery Mode (or Reset Mode)**:
   - Recovery mode is used primarily for flashing the device, which means installing or updating the system software on it.
   - When the Jetson Nano is put into recovery mode and connected to a host computer, utilities like the `sdkmanager` can recognize it and flash the appropriate software onto it.
   - It's also used for certain debugging scenarios where direct access to the device's low-level systems is required.
   
3. **Force Recovery Mode**:
   - This mode is similar to the recovery mode but is manually triggered, usually by holding down a specific button or shorting certain pins during bootup. It's a way to force the device into recovery mode if the usual method doesn't work.

### Background and Reasoning:

The reason for these modes, particularly the recovery mode, ties back to the development nature of the Jetson Nano. Unlike consumer devices which are typically static in their software after release (barring occasional updates), developer kits and platforms like the Jetson Nano are continuously evolving. Developers need a way to:

- **Update Firmware and Software**: As NVIDIA releases new versions of its JetPack SDK, which includes the Linux OS for Jetson, libraries for deep learning, computer vision, GPU computing, and more, developers need a mechanism to update their devices.

- **Debugging**: Developers often need to access the low-level systems of the Jetson Nano for debugging and development purposes. Recovery mode offers a controlled environment to do this without the regular OS interfering.

- **Restoration**: If something goes wrong, such as a corrupted OS or failed software update, the recovery mode provides a lifeline. It allows the device to be reset to a known, stable state.

In essence, these modes, especially the recovery mode, provide flexibility and control, ensuring the device can be easily updated, debugged, and restored if needed. This modularity and control are especially important for developers working on cutting-edge projects where the software environment is rapidly evolving.
